# TemperatureConverter
First Assignment CIT Module: Programming mobile devices

## Project Requirements
Design and implement an App that converts between different Temperature units and share the temperature using an email.

1. Create yourownApp icon in 3 different resolutions (it doesn’t need to be beautiful!). Use Photoshop or gimp etc.

2. Create a main Activity with at least one each of: TextView, EditText and Button components. Use at least two layout managers and embed one inside another eg. one LinearLayout inside another LinearLayout.

3. Process the events on at least one of the GUI components in 1) above. The App should perform the logic in the 'Overview' above.

4. A trigger on the first Activity launches a second Activity and passes some data to it for display.

5. ~~Localise your App’s text (in Strings.xml), including it’s name, for a second language of your choice. Change the language setting in your AVD to show that your App correctly & automatically switches to and from the second language.~~

6. ~~Show the user an Alert with three buttons using AlertDialog class and process the button presses~~

7. ~~Create an notification.~~

8. Use  method onSaveInstanceState()  to save any variables during orientation changes to be then restored.

9. ~~Draw a graphic to display some app related info.~~

10. Using a coding standard e.g. Commented code, private variables, automatic variables, use extra classes where appropriate etc. (pick only one source file to show comments etc.). List of Class files and what they do.~~
